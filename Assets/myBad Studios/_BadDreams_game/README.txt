1. I HAVE NAMED THIS GAME TEMPLATE "Bad Dreams". FURTHER MENTION OF "Bad Dreams" IMPLICITLY IMPLIES THE INCLUDED GAME TEMPLATE
2. Bad Dreams IS BASED ON THE UNITY FIRST PERSON SHOOTER SAMPLE PROJECT BUT HAS BEEN GREATLY MODIFIED
3. MOST CODE WAS WRITTEN BY ME BUT SOME CODE IS LEFT OVER FROM UNITY'S FIRST PERSON SHOOTER TEMPLATE
4. Bad Dreams IS GOING TO REMAIN IN PERPETUAL BETA STATE SINCE IT WILL BE UPDATED WITH NEW FEATURES OVER TIME
5. THIS MEANS THAT Bad Dreams IS LIKEY TO CHANGE AT ANY TIME SO...
	5.1 PLEASE MAKE SURE TO READ THE CHANGELOG BEFORE DOWNLOADING ANY UPDATES TO SEE IF THE NEW VERSION
	  - ONLY CONTAINS BUG FIXES 
	  - OR INTRODUCES NEW FEATURES / CHANGED GAMEPLAY
	  - OR BOTH
6. BECAUSE THIS IS A BETA PRODUCT IT IS MEANT TO SERVE AS A FOUNDATION TO BUILD UPON BUT IS LIKELY TO CONTAIN BUGS.
	6.1 PLEASE BE AWARE OF THIS BEFORE USING Bad Dreams
	6.2 IF YOU ARE NOT PREPARED TO ACCEPT IT THEN PLEASE FEEL FREE TO LEARN WHAT YOU CAN FROM IT AS YOU CREATE A CUSTOM GAME
	6.3 IF YOU INTEGRATE 3RD PARTY ASSETS AND THEN UPDATE Bad Dreams 
	  - IT IS LIKELY THAT YOUR INTEGRATION WILL BE LOST
	  - IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU KEEP THIRD PARTY CODE SEPARATE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND CREATE CODE LINKS BETWEEN THEM
		TO KEEP CODE BREAKAGES TO A MINIMUM. EXTENDING MY CLASSES OR USING EVENTS IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW TO ACHIEVE THIS
7. I DO NOT GUARANTEE COMPATIBILITY WITH NOR IS IT MY RESPONSIBILITY TO INTEGRATE AND 3RD PARTY ASSETS OR CODE
8. Bad Dreams ATTEMPTS TO DEMONSTRATE HOW YOU CAN USE ALL myBad Studios WORDPRESS ASSETS TOGETHER IN A SINGLE PROJECT
	8.1 Bad Dreams IS PROVIDED AS A FREE SAMPLE PROJECT TO THOSE PARTIES WHO BOUGHT ANY ASSET(S) THAT INCLUDES IT
	8.2 IT IS MY HOPE THAT Bad Dreams PROVES TO BE A HELPFUL DEMONSTRATION OR TOOL TO GUIDE YOU IN USING THE ASSETS YOU PURCHASED 
	8.3 BUT I DO NOT GUARANTEE OR PROMISE THE USEFULNESS OR SUITABILITY OF THE Bad Dreams PROJECT IN/FOR YOUR OWN USE EITHER IN WHOLE OR IN PART

9. EACH OF THE INDIVIDUAL ASSETS HAVE DOCUMENTATION AND SAMPLES SHOWING HOW TO USE THEM
	9.1 ONCE YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH THEM THE REST OF THE	CODE SHOULD BE PRETTY SELF EXPLANITORY SO THERE ISN'T DETAILED COMMENTS IN THE TEMPLATE
	9.2 THAT WILL MORE THAN LIKELY CHANGE IN FUTURE UPDATES, THOUGH, SO PLEASE JUST SIT TIGHT
	9.3 IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE ASK ON THE OFFICIAL FORUM THREAD, ON THE FACEBOOK GROUP OR EMAIL ME AND I'LL BE GLAD TO HELP YOU OUT! 

Or in layman terms, here is what it all boils down to... I am giving you a project in good faith in the hopes that
it proves useful to you. If it does then I am happy to hear it... conversely, I'm sorry if you don't find it useful. It is provided
as a free template to get you started if you want to use all the kits that are at your disposal but at the end of the day, this is just
a sample project and you are under no obligation to use it in whole or in part. You are free to delete the sample project entirely and use 
each of the assets in their own right ...but I am really hoping that you will find the template useful.

It is not perfect, I know. For instance, I have not tested it on mobiles yet, there is no opening music and WebGL (as usual) is giving me grief...
but nevertheless, I hope you enjoy playing and learning from it and that it can give you a boost in getting your game of the ground! :)

I'm always happy to hear from my customers so feel free to contact me with any thoughts or suggestions :)

p.s. the opening intro... I just made that cause I thought it was simple and cute but it is entirely optional.
If you don't want the intro then just disable or delete the canvas in the Bootstrap scene and on the Bootstrap GameObject just tick the box to turn
off the intro. Done. :)

I think that's about it... Enjoy :D
